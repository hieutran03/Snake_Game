SNAKE GAME'S GUIDE

Note for Vietnameses: Turn off unikey before playing this game.
Use 'w' (up), 's' (down), 'a' (left), 'd' (right) to move the snake.
Try to reach and eat apples to earn points.
If you try to move to yourself or out of the map, you'll lose a life.
You have only three lifes, so be careful.
You win the game when the snake fills the map up.
This game doesn't have any levels, but you can fix the width and height 
of the map by changing the values of X and Y(X>3, Y>1) in the "common.h" file.
If you think it's so boring, just press 'x', and the game is over.

Have fun, guys!
