Use 'w' (up), 's' (down), 'a' (left), 'd' (right) to move the snake.
Try to reach and eat apples to earn points.
If you try to move to yourself or out of map, you'll lose a life.
You have only three lifes, so be careful.
If you think it's so boring, just press 'x' and the game is over.

Have fun, guys!
